### Project Title
**Version Control Project: Improve Bike Share Exploration Code** :bike:

### Description
The bikeshare.py file is an interactive tool used to analyze and learn about bike share usage in 3 cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user selects a city to analyze, along with a month and weekday to focus on (optional). Commits in this repo are to improve documentation, make the original code more efficient, and upload the project to my [remote github repository!] (https://github.com/jmc32691/pdsnd_github)

### Files used

All the credit goes to...**Udacity!** I could not have learned all of this material and completed the Bike Share data project without Udacity's clear instructions, detailed lessons and easy to understand modules. Thank you for teaching me so many new skills.
